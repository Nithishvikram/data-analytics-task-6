The online_sales dataset, specifically its orders table, provides valuable insights into sales performance over time using key SQL operations. By applying EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date), we can isolate and analyze monthly trends. Grouping data by both year and month helps in tracking seasonal patterns and sales fluctuations. Aggregating revenue using SUM(amount) reveals total earnings, while COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) helps measure sales volume. Sorting the output with ORDER BY organizes the data chronologically for better readability. Additionally, filtering the dataset for specific periods, such as a quarter or fiscal year, allows for targeted analysis, making this approach ideal for sales reporting and business strategy.
